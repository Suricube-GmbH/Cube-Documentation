# Signal summer

The signal summer module is a selective sum operator.
This module takes as input the 16-bit signals generated by the ASG. 
The output goes to a (FPGA-wired) specific DAC.

By default, it does nothing and just forwards 1 signal to a DAC 
(example: the signal summer #2 forwards the signal from ASG #2 to the DAC #2 ). 

!!! Caution 
    The parameters of the signal summer don't reset if you change the ASG signal manually. 
    Keep that in mind, or reset, or else you might have some weird outputs.

However, by changing the parameters you can select which input signals
should be used to compute the outgoing signal. 
Internally, each bit  of a variable acts as a flag to determine if the corresponding signal should be used : 
$$ out = \sum_i{in_i * bit_i} $$

!!! Warning 
    Keep in mind that the summation is done in the 16-bit realm, and not in the voltage realm !
    As such, adding 2 "0V signals" gives a resulting signal of 5V (or overflowing to -5V).
