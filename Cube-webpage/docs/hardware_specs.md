# Hardware specification

## Analog output details

### High-speed output
* 16-bit resolution
* From -5V to +5V
* 1 MHz update rate

!!! Todo
    [oscilloscope measurement about 0 to 65535 transition]  
    [ADC calibration / non-linearity]  
    [graph about typical noise ]


### Low-speed output
* 16-bit resolution
* From 0 to 5V
* 50kHz update rate
* [graph about 0 to 65535 transition]
* [graph about noise / non-linearity ?]  => how is the non-linearity handled ?
